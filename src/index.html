          <h4>Call for Participation</h4>
          <p>
            We ask prospective attendees to choose a challenge in a social dodiv
            and submit a 1-4 page (excluding references) position paper using
            the ACM Conference Proceedings Preliminary Article Template on how
            particular XR affordances (e.g., spatial interaction, immersion) can
            solve that challenge. Good papers will detail a specific social
            challenge (e.g., increasing science literacy), why solutions
            inadequately address the problem, and the current barriers with
            solving the social problem. The rest of the paper will discuss the
            XR affordance and why it is uniquely positioned to address the
            social challenge. Papers may reference in-progress or recent work.
            Lastly, the paper will discuss what technological advances and/or
            future research is necessary for the affordance to better address
            the social challenge and which hurdles/harms need to be considered.

            While we aim to accept as many attendees as possible, selection of
            workshop participants will be chosen based on the diversity of uses
            for their XR affordance, and how well the vision addresses the
            challenges of the social problem. There are more spaces for
            participants than demoers, and participants may be selected for the
            workshop but not to demo. All accepted papers will be published as a
            collection on ArXiv following the conference.
          </p>
          <p>
            Optionally, participants can apply to demo during the workshop.
            Please use [link] for submissions.

          <p>
            Please note that at least one author of each accepted submission
            must attend the workshop and that all participants must register for
            both the workshop and for at least one day of the conference.

          <h2>Accessibility</h2>
          <p>
            We strive to make the workshop as accessible as possible. All
            submissions must adhere to the CHI paper submission guidelines. As
            the workshop will be fully in person and interactive with no formal
            overhead projections. Position papers will be both printed and in
            digital format for participants to access. We will provide writing
            utensils and paper for brainstorming, but participants can also
            brainstorm with their laptop if preferred. Participants that are
            bringing demos will be asked to consider the accessibility of their
            artifact. Demos that involve head-mounted displays will be asked to
            provide to ensure that alternate ways of viewing the experience such
            as videos or photos.
